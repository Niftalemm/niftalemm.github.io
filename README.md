# My First Landing Page Website

Welcome to my first landing page website! Check it out [here](https://niftalemm.github.io/).

## About the Project

This project is built using the **Massively** template by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/). It is a text-heavy, article-oriented design with a huge background image and new parallax implementation, along with scroll effects powered by **Scrollex**. This template is a departure from the one-pagers I've done lately, fulfilling user requests and incorporating new techniques I've wanted to try.

## Features

- **Parallax Background**: A new parallax implementation.
- **Scroll Effects**: Powered by Scrollex.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website looks great on all devices.
